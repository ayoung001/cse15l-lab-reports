# **LAB REPORT 5: "Using a Script to Run Many Files"**

## **Step 1: Different Results, Same Test**

I used the command `diff` on the `test-results` file for `your-markdown-parse` and `markdown-parse`. 

The specific command I ran was: 

`diff your-markdown-parse/markdown-parse/results.txt markdown-parse/results.txt > more-results.txt`

which piped the results from the diff into a new text file. 

Inside the file, the following results were found:

## **Step 2: Two Different Answers**

For `576.md`, the implementation that I cloned was correct while our implementation was wrong. As seen in the image: 

![figure 1](5figure1.png)

my implementation, which is on top, printed out nothing while the cloned `markdown-parse` printed out the correct result. The bug in my `markdown-parse` is that I did not correctly check for links in markdown for links after colons. 

As for the code that should be changed, I would just have to add another if statement checking for colons and if it satisfies markdown rules. 

For `510.md`, the implementation that I cloned was incorrect while our implementation was right. As seen in the image: 

![figure 2](5figure2.png)

The cloned implementation, which had the result `[/uri]` is incorrect and should print out nothing because in the original test, there is a space between the bracket and parentheses. 

The code that should be fixed is: 

![figure 3](5figure3.png)

We need to test whether there is a space between the "]" and "(". In order to be a link, there shouldn't be a space between the closing bracket and open parentheses.
